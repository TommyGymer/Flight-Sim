## Deciding not to use Java

Despite my prior experience developing in Java, I have decided not to use Java due to the lack of information and libraries available for 3D rendering in Java.

Since OpenGL is written for C and C++, all resources and libraries for Java OpenGL are outdated mappings to the C and C++ libraries. While these methods would work, they are not the latest versions and would be missing a number of updates and future updates.

[JOGL](https://jogamp.org/jogl/www/) and [LWJGL](https://www.lwjgl.org/) are two decent examples of Java mappings for the OpenGL libraries. However, both are a number of years old and not in any particularly active development.
