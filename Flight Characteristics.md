## Flight Characteristics

In order of difficultly:
1. Direct coefficients on the input device axies
2. Manually entered flight characteristics
	- Itertia
	- Mass
	- Thrust
3. Auto calculation based on a 3D model
-	Thrust and mass would still need to be entered manually
-	Could use vertex weight painting to calculate inertia; my research for a [TVC-system](https://github.com/TommyGymer/TVC-system) should contain all the physics required for this
