## Analysis
---
### Overview
---
- RC-PC will be a model aircraft flight simulation.
- It is intended as both a game and a realistic simulator.
- It should be capable of allowing a user to create their own aircraft.
- This process should be possible using only knowledge of Blender.

#### Stakeholders

My target market will include:
- People interested in simulators as games (a similar demographic to Microsoft Flight Sim)
- People interested in realistic simulation for flight practice
