## Analysis
---
### Overview
---
- RC-PC will be a model aircraft flight simulation.
- It is intended as both a game and a realistic simulator.
- It should be capable of allowing a user to create their own aircraft.
- This process should be possible using only knowledge of Blender.

#### Stakeholders

My target market will include:
- People interested in simulators as games (a similar demographic to Microsoft Flight Sim)
- People interested in realistic simulation for flight practice

### Existing products and projects
---
#### RC Desk Pilot
- Needs a picture
- Range of model aircraft available
- Tools to make your own aircraft
- Connects to a range of different controllers
- Weather features
- Sufficiently accurate physics

#### Microsoft Flight Sim 2020
- Needs picture
- Range of very detailed aircraft models available
- Highly detailed environment
- Unresonably accurate physics and weather

### Features
---
- Premade models available
- Tools to make new models
- Loading these models
- Animation of these models with the input
- Compatability with a number of input devices
- Accurate physics while maintaining performance
- Resonable environment

### Implementaion
---
- OpenGL based rendering with C++/C#
- Using prebaked physics to remove the need for real time CFD

#### Limitations of implementation
- Fairly resource intensive due to the full frame rate rendering
- Prebaked physics will be slightly inaccurate compared to a real time CFD simulation
