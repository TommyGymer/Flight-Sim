## Research and Initial Development
---
Due to my lack of previous experence with both OpenGL and C# for graphical rendering, I intend to first produce a simple application to learn how OpenGL can be used with imported .obj files and render them.

Once I have a better understanding of the architecture, I should be able to construct the application without the need for copying code directly.
