## AntTweakBar
---
From the AntTweakBar README:
`AntTweakBar is a small and easy-to-use C/C++ library that allows programmers to quickly add a light and intuitive GUI into OpenGL and DirectX based graphic programs to interactively tweak parameters.`

No longer using AntTweakBar as it is not available on vcpkg

Using [[Imgui]] instead as it provides similar functionality and is available on vcpkg
